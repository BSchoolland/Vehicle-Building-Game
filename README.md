# Wrecking Wheels
### Description
This is a browser game where you build a contraption to complete levels.  Unlock new parts, solve physics based puzzles, and battle enemy contraptions!  I created this game because of my love of building games, and to challenge myself and grow as a coder.  
### Setup
To get this to run on your local machine, you'll need to run
`npm install`
and then
`node server.js`
finally, go to localhost:3000 and you should see the game!
