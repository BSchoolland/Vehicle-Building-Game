    <h3>A quick explanation</h3>
    <li>If you have wheels, you can move with 'a' and 'd'</li>
    <li>You delete blocks by clicking on them and pressing backspace </li>
    <li>You rotate blocks by clicking on them and pressing R</li>
    <li>You can create levels in the level editor, you'll have to set up allowed blocks and objectives. Also make sure each level has at least one Building Area Block</li>
    <li>You can test levels now, using the test level button.</li>
    <li>If you save a level, you'll get a file in downloads called level.json. If you press load and select that file,
        it will come back. (this also works for sending levels to your friends, just make sure they save any level
        they're working on before loading yours because it will overwrite)</li>
